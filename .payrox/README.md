PayRox helper artifacts

This folder holds artifacts generated by analysis/refactor tools and
experimental helper files. Per project policy, nothing in `.payrox` is
considered part of the main `contracts/` tree; keep generated interfaces,
facets, and reports here.

Files moved/generated here in recent work:

- `.payrox/generated/interfaces/` — generated interface placeholders moved from `contracts/interfaces/`.
- `.payrox/pinned-go-beyond.md` — small pinned facts pack loaded by the server.

If you need to revert runtime edits made to `server/main.py` (pinned context / bucket hints), run:

```powershell
# revert server/main.py to HEAD from origin
git checkout -- server/main.py
```

Or create a branch and edit as needed. Do not commit `.payrox/generated/` unless intentional.
